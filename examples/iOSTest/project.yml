version: 1.0.0
# Project-level configurations and build settings. You can add as many as you want here.
# If you do add another configuration that's not one of debug, release, you must specify
# its type as either 'debug' or 'release'.
configurations:
  # An individual project-level configuration
  debug:
    # Project configuration profiles. Each profile will provide a subset of configuration
    # settings. You will almost always want 'general', as this defines a large portion of
    # the settings you would get by default with a project.
    #
    # Additional profiles can be used to produce a project that more closely matches your
    # needs. For example if you mainly need iOS targets, then applying the 'ios' profile
    # will provide some additional sensible defaults for new targets.
    profiles:
    - general:debug
    - ios:debug
    # Configuration overrides go here. After all of the configuration profiles have been
    # applied, any settings here will be applied on top. This may be useful to provide
    # defaults for code signing for example.
    overrides:
      IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET: '9.1'
  release:
    profiles:
    - general:release
    - ios:release
    overrides:
      IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET: '9.1'
# Build targets. Currently any kind of target should be supported, however only common
# types have been tested.
targets:
  # An individual build target. The name you choose here will correlate to its name in
  # the project navigator.
  iOSTest:
    # The directory where the source, resource and framework files for this project are located.
    # Every file will be picked up recursively in this directory and added to the project.
    sources: iOSTest
    # Language-specific resources contained in lproj files have special mechanics in an Xcode
    # project, so in order to simplify things, Xcodegen will search in the root of the sources
    # directory for your .lproj files. Subdirectories will not be scanned.
    # If you wish to store your lproj files in another directory or a subdirectory, you can
    # specify the 'i18n-resources' key. Any lproj folders will be ignored as normal
    # source/resource files.
    i18n-resources: iOSTest/lproj
    # Excludes provide a means of customising which files are added to a project.
    excludes:
      # File excludes should be file globs, for example to exclude all markdown files from
      # a project, you would add '**/*.md' to the list.
      files:
      - "**/*.md"
    # References configure any dependencies this target has on other targets, both in this
    # project and in external projects.
    # There are three possible values for each reference entry:
    # - A string beginning with 'sdkroot:' will be treated as a reference to a system library
    #   or framework. Example values are 'sdkroot:UIKit.framework' and 'sdkroot:libz.tbd'
    # - Any other string will be treated as a target name to search for within this project
    # - An object will be treated as information to use when associating a subproject's products
    #   with this target, e.g.:
    #   - location: Carthage/Checkouts/BrightFutures/BrightFutures.xcodeproj
    #     frameworks:
    #     - name: BrightFutures.framework
    #       copy: true
    #       codeSignOnCopy: false
    references:
    - sdkroot:UIKit.framework
    # The platform for this target. Supported platforms are 'ios' and 'mac'.
    platform: ios
    # The type of target. This corresponds to the UTI Apple associates with each target type.
    # ':' will be replaced with the namespace of Apple's UTI, e.g. ':application' will
    # become 'com.apple.product-type.application'.
    #
    # Some common types are ':application', ':bundle.unit-test', and ':bundle.ui-testing'.
    type: ":application"
    # Configuration settings for this target. This will override project-level settings.
    # This is generally useful for providing settings such as the location of the plist file,
    # and the bundle identifier.
    #
    # The settings within this configuration object will be applied to every configuration
    # for this target.
    #
    # If you wanted different settings applied for each configuration, you can use the
    # following format instead:
    # configurations:
    #   debug:
    #     ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME: AppIconDebug
    #   release:
    #     ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME: AppIconRelease

    # Target configuration profiles to apply to this target. This will override project-level
    # settings. You should usually apply a platform profile e.g. platform:ios. Currently 'ios'
    # and 'mac' are supported.

# Project variants allow you to generate multiple xcode projects from one spec file.
# Each variant will output an equivalent project file, e.g. 'dev.xcodeproj' and 'beta.xcodeproj'.
#
# A project variant can override or extend any property already set by the equivalent target
# declared in the targets group. The target name specified in the variant must match the target
# name in order for the overrides to apply.
variants:
  # A '$base' variant is a special variant that correlates directly to the default project generated
  # by xcodegen - 'project.xcodeproj'. This variant will always output to 'project.xcodeproj'.
  # If you omit this variant, it will be implicitly included when generating projects.
  $base:
    # By declaring a variant as abstract, it prevents an xcode project from being written. This can be
    # useful in scenarios where the base variant is not useful without additional files and configuration
    # defined by other variants. Any variant can be declared as abstract.
    abstract: true
  dev:
    # Any target can be declared within a variant, and the declaration syntax is identical to the
    # 'targets' group in behaviour, however there are no required parameters in these definitions
    # as they act as overrides for the base target definitions.
